## Project Overview

This series documents the development of a two-wheeled self-balancing robot based on the WHEELTEC B570 platform. The project uses an **STM32F103C8T6** microcontroller and covers essential embedded systems concepts including:

- **Sensor Integration**: MPU6050 6-axis IMU for attitude sensing
- **Signal Processing**: Kalman filtering for noise reduction
- **Motor Control**: PWM-based DC motor speed control
- **Control Theory**: PID controllers for balance and velocity

### Hardware Platform

The robot uses the WHEELTEC B570 kit with the S28A adapter board. Key components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| MCU | STM32F103C8T6 (72MHz ARM Cortex-M3) |
| IMU | MPU6050 (3-axis accelerometer + 3-axis gyroscope) |
| Motors | DC motors with magnetic encoders |
| Driver | TB6612FNG dual H-bridge |

### Project Structure

The tutorials (MPs) are organized as follows:

1. **MP1**: OLED Display Driver (I2C)
2. **MP2**: MPU6050 IMU Integration
3. **MP3**: Kalman Filter Implementation
4. **MP4**: Motor Encoder Configuration
5. **MP5**: PWM Motor Speed Control
6. **MP6**: System Timer Configuration
7. **MP7**: PID Control Implementation

### Development Approach

This project follows a modular approach, building each subsystem independently before integration. The code structure is based on the Standard Peripheral Library, making it accessible for beginners while maintaining good practices.

> **Note**: Each MP builds upon the previous ones. Complete them in order for the best learning experience.
